                As the average temperature of earth is rising at nearly twice the rate of the rate it was 50 years ago. This rapid warming trend cannot be explained by natural cycles alone, scientists have concluded. The only way to explain the pattern is to include the effect of greenhouse gases (GHGs) emitted by humans.
                <br>
                Mainly because of fossil fuels -> petrol, diesel etc.
When burnt they emit GHG’s, Carbon Dioxide. Which pollute the environment. And also, many Industries emit such GHG’s.
In the Agricultural Industry, Excess of Nitrogen is used as a fertilizer which releases nitrous oxide.

One of the Main Problems is Deforestation, which occurs due to overpopulation. The Trees act as Carbon Sinks. And When we burn them of cut them for space, timber, and paper, and a lot of other reasons.
