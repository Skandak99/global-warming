        Like we will try and focus on things that our in our immediate control, and I’m not discouraging anyone, but for people who have little time, small changes that will have quite an impact. <br> So, I’m focusing on the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation. We can reduce the burning of fossil fuels, by using green energy like solar, hydro, thermal etc. We can use electric cars instead of petrol or diesel cars, or hybrid if you want to go for long distances too. <br> And deforestation, we can stop using things from cut trees, like we can reduce the amount of paper we use, and use <a href="https://www.notion.so/desktop" target="blank">Notion</a> and <a href="https://evernote.com/download" target="blank"></a> for taking notes instead of using spare pieces of paper. And <a href="https://todoist.com/downloads/windows?lang=en">Todoist</a> for a to do list and habits. And if your using a phone, maybe we can use the features it gives instead of paper, like remainder, notes etc. If u want to u can explore the internet for more tools that will help u save paper. <br>
        And also this very simple thing, using an online newspaper, and you might not think its much, but if you use an online newspaper for a year u save around 30-50pages a day, and in 365 days, one year imagine how much you will save. And if you tell 100 people and if 60 people listen, and if they tell 100 people, it will grow exponentially. So, this is the link for <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/" target="blank">The Hindu</a> and <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/" target="blank">Times of India</a>
        But I feel these will help but only to a certain extent. One person can only do so much. But let’s say if a million, a thousand? Or even a hundred. The amount saved will increase a lot. If each of you, you share this to as many people as possible and even if only 1/10th do their part the amount of paper saved will increase exponentially, and few might even switch to electrical cars. I feel Awareness is key with them doing a little, tiny even but a tiny part.
